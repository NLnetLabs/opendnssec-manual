## Hardware Security Modules (HSM)

OpenDNSSEC has been tested with a lot of Hardware Security Modules (HSM). This page lists the products that has been tested – by the developers or by credible sources – to work with OpenDNSSEC. If you need additional information, references or if you are a vendor who want to contribute with test results and/or equipment, please contact support@opendnssec.org.

### Other Sources of Information

We have also conducted a review of four different HSMs. The report can be read (here)[assets/A-Review-of-Hardware-Security-Modules-Fall-2010.pdf].

If you’re interesting in using a HSM you may also be interested in reading the [HSM Buyer's Guide](hsmbuyers.md).
