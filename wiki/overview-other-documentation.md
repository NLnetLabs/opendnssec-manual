### Overview of other documentation


The following somewhat outdated information is also available.  The OpenDNSSEC 1.4 documentation for example is still a good reference on configuration, concepts, etcetera as the changes and improvements can be easily inferred.  For example, the ``ods-ksmutil`` command is now ``ods-enforcer`` but the usage is mostly the same.

- [OpenDNSSEC 1.3.x documentation](assets/opendnssec13.md)
