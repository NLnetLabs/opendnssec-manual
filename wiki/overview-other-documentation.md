### Overview of other documentation


The following somewhat outdated information is also available.  The OpenDNSSEC 1.4 documentation for example is still a good reference on configuration, concepts, etcetera as the changes and improvements can be easily inferred.  For example, the `ods-ksmutil` command is now `ods-enforcer` but the usage is mostly the same.

- [OpenDNSSEC 1.4.x documentation](opendnssec14.md)
    - [ods-ksmutil command referece](opendnssec14-ksmutil.md)
- [OpenDNSSEC 1.3.x documentation](opendnssec13.md)
    - [Migrating to 1.4](opendnssec14-migration.md)
