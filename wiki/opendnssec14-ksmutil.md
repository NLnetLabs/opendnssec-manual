## ods-ksmutil

This is a utility that allows several different actions to be performed (relatively) easily.  Note that this command utiliity is part of the now outdated OpenDNSSEC 1.4.  It is kept for reference.

### Global Options

    --config <config>          aka -c

Change the conf.xml file that is used, from the default.

### Command: --version

    ods-ksmutil --version              aka -V

Report version information

### Command: setup

    ods-ksmutil setup

Delete current contents of database (including any keys) and then import repository list, kasp.xml and zonelist.xml into a database.

#### Command: start|stop|notify

    ods-ksmutil start|stop|notify

Start, stop or SIGHUP the ods-enforcerd

### Command: update

    ods-ksmutil update kasp
    ods-ksmutil update zonelist
    ods-ksmutil update conf
    ods-ksmutil update all

Update database by importing contents of kasp.xml,  zonelist.xml or the repository list from conf.xml into a database (or all three). For zonelist and conf the update replaces the existing contents of the database (but note the keys are not updated by any of these commands). For kasp the update replaces or adds to the existing content, but does not delete any policies. The command 'ods-ksmutil' policy purge can be used to remove polices with no zones associated with them. 

Note that 'update kasp' is equivalent to 'import policy' and 'update zonelist' is equivalent to 'import zonelist'.

###  Command: zone add

    ods-ksmutil zone add

Add a zone to both zonelist.xml and the database (both locations read from conf.xml).

**Options**

    --zone <zone>                     aka -z
    [--policy <policy>]               aka -p
    [--signerconf <signerconf.xml>]   aka -s
    [--input <input>]                 aka -i
    [--in-type <input type>]          aka -j
    [--output <output>]               aka -o
    [--out-type <output type>]        aka -q
    [--no-xml]                        aka -m

- The <input type> and <output type> fields specify what kind of adaptor should be configured for the zone. Valid values are 'File' (default) and 'DNS' for both input and output:
  - When using a 'File' adaptor the <input> field specifies the location of the unsigned zone and the <output> field specifies the location of the signed zone
  - When using a 'DNS' adaptor the <input> and <output> fields specify the location of the xml file that describes the adapter to be used e.g. {prefix}/etc/opendnssec/addns.xml
- Defaults are provided for all options but zone name:
  - --policy will use the 'default' policy
  - --signerconf will default to use the {prefix}/var/opendnssec/signerconf/<zone>.xml file
  - --input will default to {prefix}/var/opendnssec/unsigned/<zone> for a 'File' adaptor or (available from 1.4.3) {prefix}/var/opendnssec/addns.xml for a 'DNS' adaptor
  - --in-type will default to 'File'
  - --output will default to {prefix}/var/opendnssec/signed/<zone> for a 'File' adaptor or (available from 1.4.3) {prefix}/var/opendnssec/addns.xml for a 'DNS' adaptor
  - --out-type will default to 'File'
- The `no-xml` flag is useful when adding a number of zones; it prevents zonelist.xml from being written to thus speeding up the process. If the `no-xml` flag is used then after all the zones have been added then the zonelist file will need to be updated via the command:

    ods-ksmutil zonelist export

### Command: zone delete

    ods-ksmutil zone delete

Delete a zone to both zonelist.xml and the database (both locations read from conf.xml).

**Options**

    --zone <zone> | --all             aka -z / -a

### Command: zone list

    ods-ksmutil zone list

List zones from the zonelist.xml

### Command: repository list

    ods-ksmutil repository list

List repositories from the database

### Command: policy export

Export a policy from the database in kasp.xml format. 

**Options**

    --policy <policy> | --all         aka -p / -a

### Command: policy import

    ods-ksmutil policy import

Update the database with the contents of kasp.xml; identical to `update kasp`. (Note this does not delete any policies. The command 'ods-ksmutil' policy purge can be used to remove polices with no zones associated with them.)

### Command: policy list

    ods-ksmutil policy list

List policies available.

### Command: policy purge (experimental)

    ods-ksmutil policy purge

Delete all policies and associated keys if there are no zones currently using the policy. This command should be used with caution and it is recommended to backup your database before using it.

### Command: key list

    ods-ksmutil key list

List information about keys in zone.

**Options**

    Pre 1.4.4:
    [--verbose]
    --zone <zone> | --all             aka -z / -a
 
    1.4.4 and later:
    [--verbose]                              aka -v
    [--zone <zone>]                          aka -z
    [--keystate <state>| --all]              aka -e / -a
    [--keytype <type>]                       aka -t

By default:

- keys for all zones are listed when using  'ods-ksmutil key list' 
- the 'ods-ksmutil key list' command does not list keys in the GENERATE or DEAD state. 

In 1.4.4 the command was extended to support filters on key state and key type.

- The --all option now results in a listing of keys in all key states, including GENERATE and DEAD

### Command: key export

    ods-ksmutil key export

Export key information in a suitable format for putting into a zonefile

**options**

    --zone <zone> | --all             aka -z
    [--keystate <state>]              aka -e
    [--keytype <type>]                aka -t
    [--ds]                            aka -d

### Command: key import

    import

Add a key which was created outside of the OpenDNSSEC code into the database

**Options**

    --cka_id <CKA_ID>                 aka -k
    --repository <repository>         aka -r
    --zone <zone>                     aka -z
    --bits <size>                     aka -b
    --algorithm <algorithm>           aka -g
    --keystate <state>                aka -e
    --keytype <type>                  aka -t
    --time <time>                     aka -w
    [--check-repository]              aka -C
    [--retire <retire>]               aka -y

- (Available from 1.4.3) If the --check-repository flag is used then the import will fail if no key with the matching cka_id is available in the repository.

### Command: key rollover

    ods-ksmutil key rollover

Rollover active keys on a zone or policy

**Options**

    --zone <zone> | --policy <policy>
    --keytype <type> | --all

`keytype` specifies a single type of key to roll. After running, the enforcer will be woken up so that the signer can be sent the new information.

If the policy that the zone is on specifies that keys are shared then all zones on that policy will be rolled. A backup of the sqlite DB file is made (if appropriate).

> :memo:
> From 1.4.1 either the keytype must be specified or the 'â€“all' option is required for this command. This is to avoid the possibility of rolling more keys than intended by accidentally forgetting to specify a key type.

### Command: key purge

    ods-ksmutil key purge

Remove keys that are in the `Dead` state from the repository and from the enforcer DB

**Options**

    --zone <zone> | --policy <policy>        aka -z | -p

### Command: key generate

    ods-ksmutil key generate

Create enough keys for the given policy to last for the period of time given by interval. 

**Options**

    --policy <policy>                     aka -p
    --interval <interval>                 aka -n
 
    [--zonetotal <zone total>]            aka -Z
    --auto-accept                         aka -A

- Intervals are specified in the format used in the configuration files
- (Available in 1.4.2) Optionally specify a total number of zones to generate keys for (default is all the zones on the policy) with the --zonetotal parameter.
- The command predicts the number of keys that will be generated and then the user is requested to confirm the operation. If the --auto-accept parameter is specified the confirmation step is skipped. 

###  Command: key ds-seen

    ods-ksmutil key ds-seen

Indicate that a submitted DS record has appeared in the parent zone (this triggers the completion of a KSK rollover, or the provisioning of a standby KSK).

**Options**

    --zone <zone>                            aka -z
    --keytag <keytag> | --cka_id <CKA_ID>    aka -x / -k
    [--no-notify|-l]                         aka -l
    [--no-retire|-f]                         aka -f

- Specifiying a zone will speed up the search of keys by narrowing the field but is not mandatory
- cka_id can be used to resolve a keytag clash.
- By default the command will simultaneously move the current key into the retired state. If you wish to delay this step then add the --no-retire flag and use the ksk-retire command when needed.
- (Available in 1.4.3) By default the command will notify the enforcer there has been a change so that the changes take full effect. If you wish to delay this step then add the --no-notify flag and use the ods-control enforcer notifycommand after all the ds-seen commands have been issued. 

### Command: key ksk-retire

    ods-ksmutil key ksk-retire

Move a key from active to retired (if a replacement key is already active).

**Options**

    --zone <zone>                         aka -z
    --keytag <keytag>                     aka -x
    --cka_id <CKA_ID>                     aka -k

Specifiying a zone alone will retire the oldest key in the zone; if the cka_id or keytag are specified then that key will be retired. The specified key must be in the active state, and there must be 2 or more active keys on the zone for this command to work.

### Command: key delete

    ods-ksmutil key delete

Remove a key from the system.

**Options**

    --cka_id <CKA_ID>                     aka -k
    --no-hsm 

Keys in the GENERATE or DEAD state can be removed from the system at any time as they are not actually being used. The no-hsm flag indicates that the key should be left on the HSM.

### Command: backup done

    ods-ksmutil backup done

> :memo:
> DEPRECATED: This command is deprecated in OpenDNSSEC 1.4.0 and onwards; it will be removed in OpenDNSSEC 2.0.0 and beyond.
>  It can be replaced with the following command sequence:
>     ods-ksmutil backup prepare
ods-ksmutil backup commit
#OR# ods-ksmutil backup rollback
> The improvement of switching to this is sequence is transactional security of the backup.  Prior to this change, there were two ways of making uncertain backups:
>
> - Running ods-ksmutil backup done after the actual backup: If the Enforcer was running and creating keys during the backup, the newest keys might not have been backed up, but they would still be marked as if they were by the backup done command.
> - Running ods-ksmutli backup done before the actual backup: If the backup failed, then there would be no way to fix this.  In the new situation, one can retry or execute ods-ksmutil backup rollback
>
> This sequence creates time between a preparation phase and the actual commit of the backup.  This time is meant for actually doing the backup.

Indicate that a backup of the given repository has been done, all non-backed up keys will now be marked as backed up.
This is especially important if the repository used has the RequireBackup flag set.

**Note**: Keys generated between a backup being made and the backup done command being run will be erroneously marked as having been backed up. To avoid this, either choose a backup schedule that doesn't run while the enforcer might be generating keys, or shutdown the enforcer while a backup is performed.

**Options**

    --repository <repository>     aka -r
--force

- (If no options are given then all repositories are marked as backed up.) Include this call in a HSM backup process to avoid warnings or errors about using non-backed up keys.
- If the --force option is not used then a manual confirmation step is required to complete the backup.

### Command: backup prepare

    ods-ksmutil backup prepare

Mark all keys in preparation of an HSM key backup.  Later invocation of ods-ksmutil backup commit or ods-ksmutil backup rollback, will only influence these marked keys.

This command is intended as part of the following key backup procedure:

- ods-ksmutil backup prepare
- Make the actual HSM key backup
- ods-ksmutil backup commit (or, in case of problems, ods-ksmutil backup rollback)

This is especially important if the repository used has the RequireBackup flag set.

**Options**

    --repository <repository>     aka -r

(If no options are given then all keys in all repositories are marked for backed up.) Include this call in a HSM backup process to avoid warnings or errors about using non-backed up keys.

### Command: backup commit

    ods-ksmutil backup commit

Mark all keys that were previously marked with ods-ksmutil backup prepare as actually having been backed up.  This means that the Enforcer can henceforth depend on these keys.  A successful backup is a necessary precondition for the dependency on keys if the RequireBackup flag is set.

This command is intended as part of the following key backup procedure:

- ods-ksmutil backup prepare
- Make the actual HSM key backup
- ods-ksmutil backup commit (or, in case of problems, ods-ksmutil backup rollback)

**Options**

    --repository <repository>     aka -r

(If no options are given then all keys in all repositories that were marked before are made available to the Enforcer.) Include this call in a HSM backup process to avoid warnings or errors about using non-backed up keys.

### Command: backup rollback

    ods-ksmutil backup rollback

Undo the previous marking of keys for backup with ods-ksmutil backup prepare.  This means that the Enforcer cannot depend on these keys if the RequireBackup flag is set â€“ their availability is not sufficiently guaranteed.  A future backup can try again, starting once more from ods-ksmutil backup prepare.

This command is intended as part of the following key backup procedure:

- ods-ksmutil backup prepare
- Make the actual HSM key backup
- ods-ksmutil backup commit (or, in case of problems, ods-ksmutil backup rollback)

Note that OpenDNSSEC does not place restrictions on the repair of a failing HSM backup by attempting several times; the core idea is simply that ods-ksmutil backup commit is only executed when a backup has succeeded.  The command ods-ksmutil backup rollback exists to handle persisting problems with backups, and to enable the backup procedure to start again with marking all the keys that are available for backup at that moment.  It is probably good practice to round off a backup procedure with either commit or rollback on the same day (or other timeslot) as prepare was invoked.

**Options**

    --repository <repository>     aka -r

(If no options are given then all keys in all repositories will have their backup-preparation marking udone.)

### Command: backup list

    ods-ksmutil backup list

List the backups that have been made on the given repository.

**Options**

    --repository <repository>     aka -r

### Command: database backup

    ods-ksmutil database backup

Make a copy of the enforcer database (if using sqlite). It makes sure that the database is in a consistent state by taking a lock out first.

**Options**

    [--output <output>]       aka -o

If --output is omitted then the usual enforcer.db.backup is used.

### Command: rollover list

    ods-ksmutil rollover list

List the expected dates and times of upcoming rollovers.

**Options**

    [--zone <zone>]       aka -z

### Command: zonelist export

    ods-ksmutil zonelist export

Export the zone information held in the kasp database to zonelist.xml formatted text.

### Command: zonelist import

    ods-ksmutil zonelist import

Synchronise the database with the contents of zonelist.xml; identical to `update zonelist`.

### Allowed values

When specifying a keystate the following keywords are recognised:

    GENERATED|PUBLISHED|READY|ACTIVE|RETIRED|REVOKED|DEAD

When specifying a keytype the following keywords are recognised:

    KSK|ZSK

When specifying a time (for key import) the following formats can be used:

    YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]                    (all numeric)
 
    or  D-MMM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]     (alphabetic  month)
    or  DD-MMM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]    (alphabetic  month)
    or  YYYY-MMM-DD[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]    (alphabetic month)
 
    D-MM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]          (numeric month)
    DD-MM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]         (numeric month)
    or  YYYY-MM-DD[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]     (numeric month)

... and the distinction between them is given by the location of the hyphens.
